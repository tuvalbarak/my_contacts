# my_contacts

I created a contacts app in Kotlin, which was built using the MVVM architecture, Room DB, LiveData, Lifecycle, Repository, DAO, VM, Flow, Coroutines and NavGraph. 

The app is written in a way that it remains stateless throughout its entire flow, achieved by using the Observer pattern and Single-Activity architecture.

While writing this project, I tried emphasizing clean code, readable docs, OOP concepts, and keeping it scalable so it can grow without dramatic code changes.

I used best practices for a smooth UX/UI, such as ConstraintLayout, CoordinatorLayout and overall Design Material guidelines.

I'm attaching some photos from the app, including a link to a youtube video I made to demonstrate some flows.
